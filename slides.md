## How to make a product users need?

???

Problem:

 - Hey I got the best idea in the world, it's the next Facebook !!
 - how are you so sure
 - I know it's going to work just fine
 - How about we test that first?
 - Yeah you are right let's build it right now and we will see!

Solutions: MVP
 - get early feedback with the least amnout of energy/time/money
 - example: Dropbox create a video

## Is this solution the right one?

???

Problem:

 - Hey Thibaut, I have tons of data in different databases that I would like to ingest in my datalake! But the compliance team preconize to use encryption from end to end and we don't have a lot of engineers. 
 - Ok so you don't know if this is doable and which product on the market can do it?
 - Exact also I don't know if the design of my future architecture is what I need.
 - I am hesitating between two but I like one more. 
 - How about we try the technology with one db first?

Solution: make a Proof Of Concept
- it helps to convince management that this is worthwhile to invest more heavily on a particuliar solution.
- try the technology, fail quickly, get feedbacks early, learn from it then be able to use what fits the best your needs.
